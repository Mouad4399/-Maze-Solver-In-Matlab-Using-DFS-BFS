MATLAB Maze Solver is an interactive graphical application built in MATLAB that allows you to create, solve, and visualize mazes. You can generate mazes using a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, solve mazes using Breadth-First Search (BFS), and even convert maze images into matrices for solving.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Create mazes of various sizes using the Depth-First Search algorithm.

- **Maze Solving:** Solve mazes using Breadth-First Search and visualize the solution path.

- **Image to Maze:** Import maze images and convert them into matrix representations for solving.

- **GUI Interface:** User-friendly graphical interface for creating, solving, and exploring mazes.

## Usage

1. **Generate a Maze:**
   - Launch the application.
   - Use the GUI to specify maze dimensions and click "Generate" to create a maze.
   - Adjust the size and complexity of the maze using provided options.

2. **Solve a Maze:**
   - Load a maze or generate one.
   - Click "Solve" to find the solution path.
   - Visualize the path as it is discovered.

3. **Image to Maze:**
   - Import a maze image using the "Load Image" button.
   - The application will convert the image into a binary matrix.
   - Click "Solve" to find the solution.

## Getting Started
